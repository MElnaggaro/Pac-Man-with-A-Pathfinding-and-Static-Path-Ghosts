# Pac-Man with A* Pathfinding and Static Path Ghosts

Welcome to the **Pac-Man Project**! This is a modern, AI-powered twist on the classic Pac-Man game, featuring:

- **A* Pathfinding** for Pac-Man: Smart navigation through the maze.
- **Static Path Ghosts**: Ghosts follow pre-defined routes, making gameplay challenging and strategic.
- **Python Implementation**: Clean, readable code for learning and extension.

## üöÄ Features

- **Classic Pac-Man Gameplay**: Eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and chase high scores!
- **A* Algorithm**: Pac-Man uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to pellets or escape ghosts.
- **Static Path Ghosts**: Each ghost has a unique, static path, making their movement predictable but still dangerous.
- **Easy to Customize**: Tweak the maze, ghost paths, or AI logic to create your own Pac-Man experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MElnaggaro/Pac-Man-with-A-Pathfinding-and-Static-Path-Ghosts.git
   cd Pac-Man-with-A-Pathfinding-and-Static-Path-Ghosts/Pacman\ Project
   ```
2. **Install Python 3.x** (if not already installed).
3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python3 Project_AI.py
   ```

## üß† How It Works

- **A* Pathfinding**: Pac-Man calculates the optimal path to the nearest pellet or away from ghosts using the A* algorithm.
- **Static Path Ghosts**: Ghosts move along fixed routes, which you can modify in the code for different behaviors.
